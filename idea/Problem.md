# Problem

### Installing
- Installing a lot of things on a new computer can be hard and you may forget to install things.
- Windows Enterprise edition is hard for the average user to install. 

### tweaks
- Window tweaks applications are really confusing to use for the average user. 
- Windows comes pre packaged with a bunch of bloatware. 

### set-up
- Windows is hard to set-up and maintain
- Even people who are tech-savy might format their windows a lot, this can save a lot of time due to configuration profiles being set up.


### Maybe in the future
- Computer does not automatically update all programs, and needs constant user actions in order to keep up to date and working well. 
- The program will create a file to prepare and organize the computer automatically (for example, .bat or add to the iso, then [.xml](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs?view=windows-11))
